# HSIC-Bottleneck
This is the released repo for our work entitled `The HSIC Bottleneck: Deep Learning without Back-Propagation`. All the experiments were produced by this repository.

### Environment
- pytorch-1.1.0
- torchvision-0.3.0
- numpy-1.16.4
- scipy-1.3.0
- tqdm-4.33.0
- yaml-5.1.1

### Usage

Each run is according to the specific task generating figure in the paper. To reproduce all the experiments that we have in the paper, you could run our batch script by the following instruction:
```sh
# in bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:gladiator8072/hsic-bottleneck.git 
source env.sh
batch.sh
```

After the batch training, you'll get the following result in your `assets/exp` folder, and please compare to our sample results under `assets/sample` folder:
For more information, please visit the running procedure page (config/READMD.md [link](config/README.md)) and (bin/README.md [link](bin/README.md)) for more information.
```sh
# there's fig* context at beginning for the convenience 
[mawand@machine HSIC-bottleneck]$ ls -l assets/exp | awk '{print $9}'
